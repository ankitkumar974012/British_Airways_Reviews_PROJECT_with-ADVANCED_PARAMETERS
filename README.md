# British_Airways_Reviews_PROJECT_with-ADVANCED_PARAMETERS

The British Airways Reviews Project aims to create an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize customer reviews of the airline. This dashboard offers users the ability to filter and analyze various metrics, including overall ratings, food quality, and entertainment features, making it a user-friendly tool for exploring the data.
T
he project utilizes two primary data sources: a CSV file containing detailed reviews, labeled "ba_reviews.csv," which offers insights into various aspects of the airline experience such as seat comfort, cabin staff service, and value for money, and another file, "countries.csv," that provides geographical context.

Data preparation involved connecting these CSV files in Tableau and establishing a relationship between the location information in the reviews and the country data to enable geographical analysis. The dashboard is designed for high interactivity, allowing users to toggle between different metrics and filter data based on parameters like timeline, seat type, traveler type, and continent.

Key features of the dashboard include a geographical map that visualizes data dynamically based on selected metrics, enhanced tooltips that offer additional information, and summary metrics displayed in a text table. Users can also see trends over time with a continuous month timeline and a double bar chart showcasing average metrics alongside the number of reviews for different aircraft groups.

The construction of the dashboard employs a floating layout for better spacing and alignment, with essential elements such as the title "British Airways Review," summary metrics, and interactive filters organized to facilitate a seamless user experience. Overall, this project promises an insightful and engaging way for users to explore British Airways reviews.
